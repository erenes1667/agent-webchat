## What You Get

### 🎨 Custom Webchat UI
A single-file, zero-dependency webchat interface with:

- **Animated pixel mascot** - 32x16 LED-style face with 5 mood states, petting mechanics, sentiment reactions, and a hidden tsundere easter egg
- **Multi-session management** - Main session + side chats + background agent sessions, all in a clean sidebar
- **Real-time streaming** - Watch your agent think and respond character by character
- **Collapsible blocks** - Thinking (yellow), tool calls (purple), and results (green) collapse into clean summaries
- **Message queue** - Send multiple messages while the agent is still processing
- **AI-powered polish** - Rewrite your messages with one click (uses Groq, free tier)
- **File uploads** - Drag & drop images, docs, zip files directly into chat
- **Archive system** - Archive, restore, and bulk-manage chat sessions
- **Fullscreen composer** - ⌘E for a distraction-free writing mode
- **Dark theme** - Beautiful purple-accented dark UI, fully customizable accent color
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - ⌘1-9 for sessions, Enter to send, ⌘E for composer

### 🧠 Agent Personality System
A complete framework for giving your AI agent a persistent identity:

- **SOUL.md** - Core personality, communication style, boundaries
- **IDENTITY.md** - Name, emoji, vibe, visual identity
- **MEMORY.md** - Long-term curated memory that persists across sessions
- **Daily notes** - Raw session logs in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Project memory** - Dedicated docs for ongoing work in `memory/projects/`
- **Heartbeat system** - Periodic proactive checks (email, calendar, etc.)

### 👥 Agent Team Architecture
A multi-agent hierarchy for complex work:

- **Main Agent** - Your primary AI personality, the one you talk to
- **Overseer** - Coordinator that breaks down tasks and delegates to specialists
- **Specialists** - Researcher, Builder, Ops agents that handle specific domains
- Each agent has its own `ROLE.md`, scratchpad, and working directory

### 📋 Mission Control + Broadcast System
A real-time coordination backend that makes your agents actually work together:

- **Convex-powered** real-time task board
- **Squad Chat** - shared communication channel between all agents (their own Slack)
- **Broadcast system** - high-priority messages that notify every agent
- **Event bus** - automatic notifications when tasks change status
- **Agent briefings** - one query gives any agent their full context on wake-up
- **QA triggers** - QA agents get auto-notified when tasks move to review/done
- **@mentions** - tag specific agents or @all in squad chat
- Task lifecycle: inbox → assigned → in_progress → review → done
- CLI wrapper (`mc.sh`) for easy agent interaction

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ ([install](https://nodejs.org))
- **OpenClaw** gateway running ([install](https://openclaw.ai))

That's it. No Python, no Docker, no build tools.

---

## Interactive Setup

The installer asks you 7 questions:

| Question | Example | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Agent name | Atlas, Nova, Echo | - |
| Agent emoji | 🦊, 🤖, 🐭 | - |
| Personality vibe | Sharp & casual, Warm & helpful, etc. | - |
| Accent color | #60a5fa, #c084fc | #c084fc |
| Gateway port | 18789 | 18789 |
| Gateway token | (from your OpenClaw config) | - |
| Install directory | ./my-agent | ./agent-webchat |

Then it generates **16 files** in ~2 seconds:

```

```

---

## Usage

### Start

```bash
cd your-agent
./start.sh
```

Opens webchat at `http://localhost:8001` and upload server at `http://localhost:8002`.

### Stop

```bash
./stop.sh
```

### Update

```bash
./update.sh
```

Updates system files (webchat UI, upload server, MC functions, scripts) while preserving all your customizations (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, token, colors). Creates a timestamped backup before any changes.

### Day-to-day

- Open `http://localhost:8001` in your browser
- Chat with your agent in the main session
- Create side chats with the **+ New Chat** button
- Background agent sessions appear automatically in the sidebar
- Pet the pixel face when you're bored (try petting for 3+ seconds...)

---

## Customization

### Change personality
Edit `SOUL.md`. This is the core of who your agent is. Make it yours.

### Change appearance
Edit `webchat/index.html` and modify the CSS variables at the top:

```css
:root {
  --accent: #c084fc;        /* Main accent color */
  --accent-bright: #d8b4fe; /* Lighter variant */
  --accent-dim: #7c3aed;    /* Darker variant */
  --bg-primary: #08080c;    /* Background */
}
```

### Enable Polish feature
Get a free API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com) and add it to the `GROQ_KEY` variable in `index.html`.

### Add team members
Create new folders in `agents/` with a `ROLE.md` defining the agent's specialty, then register them in `agents/TEAM.md`.

### Configure heartbeats
Add periodic check tasks to `HEARTBEAT.md`:

```markdown
- Check email for urgent messages
- Review calendar for upcoming events
- Check project status
```

## WebSocket Protocol

The webchat communicates with OpenClaw using Protocol v3:

```json
// Connect (authenticate)
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "uuid",
  "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 3,
    "maxProtocol": 3,
    "client": { "id": "webchat-ui", "displayName": "Agent Name", "version": "2.0.0" },
    "auth": { "token": "your-token" }
  }
}

// Send message
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "uuid",
  "method": "chat.send",
  "params": { "text": "Hello!", "sessionKey": "agent:main:main" }
}

// Receive streaming response
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": "chat",
  "payload": { "state": "delta", "message": {...}, "sessionKey": "agent:main:main" }
}
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need OpenClaw installed?**
Yes. The webchat is a frontend for OpenClaw's gateway. Install it from [openclaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai).

**Q: Can I use this with other AI backends?**
Not directly. It speaks OpenClaw's WebSocket protocol. You'd need to adapt the connection layer.

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**
No. Everything runs locally. The webchat connects to your local OpenClaw gateway. The only external call is to Groq for the optional polish feature.

**Q: Can I host this publicly?**
You could, but the gateway token would need to be secured. It's designed for local use.

**Q: How do I update my agent's memory?**
Edit `MEMORY.md` directly, or let your agent do it (it's configured to maintain its own memory files).

## Mission Control

The `mission-control-template/` directory contains all the Convex functions for the broadcast system. See [mission-control-template/README.md](./mission-control-template/README.md) for setup and usage.

The `mc.sh` CLI wrapper makes it easy for agents to interact:

```bash
# Create a task
./mc.sh task:create "Build landing page" "Full responsive design" high

# Post to squad chat
./mc.sh chat:send <agentId> "Finished the analysis, ready for review"

# Broadcast to all agents
./mc.sh broadcast <agentId> "API is back up, resume work"

# Get agent's full briefing on wake-up
./mc.sh briefing <agentId>
```
